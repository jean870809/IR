There  was  a  difference
we  used  to  be  friends
All  the  illusions  are  gone
I  know  the  difference
I  made  it  different
I  decided  that  were  through
Loving  you
is  not  the  easiest  thing  to  do
While  I  do
I  don ’t  mean  to  be  difficult  on  you  but  it ’s  true
I  feel  this  way
You ’re  so  whatever  to  me
would  you  stop  calling  me
I  don ’t  love  you  no  more
though  I  did
So  then  whatever  it ’ll  be
you ’re  whatever  to  me
And  the  though  of  you  is  passing  me  off
Whatever
So  here ’s  the  story
I ’m  really  sorry
I  can ’t  keep  up  with  you  no  more
I  don ’t  care
we  ain ’s  going  no  where
And  I  think  that  I  should  stop  lying  to  myself
Loving  you
seems  like  the  type  of  thing  that  you  would  do
Boy,it ’s  true
I  would  have  given  everything  for  you
You ’re  so  whatever  to  me
would  you  stop  calling  me
I  don ’t  love  you  no  more
though  I  did
So  then  whatever  it ’ll  be
you"re  whatever  to  me
And  the  though  of  you  is  passing  me  off
I  was  foolish  I  was  crazy  I  was  into  you
No  matter  what  I  say
I  just  cannot  walk  away
You ’re  so  whatever  to  me
would  you  stop  calling  me
I  don ’t  love  you  no  more
though  I  did
So  then  whatever  it ’ll  be
you ’re  whatever  to  me
And  the  though  of  you  is  passing  me  off
