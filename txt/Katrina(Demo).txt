katrina i cant stop looking in your eyes .
but my words dont come out straight .
i dont know what to say .
no . on
monday i tell myself u gotta wait dave ,
dont rush it . dont anticipate . take it slowly ,
it's ok . it's ok .
i just want a chance to know you to know the woman deep inside ,
yeah yeah(and)
i dont wannalook back on life to see this missed opportunity .
yeah yeah
even at the risk of looking like a fool to you,
on wednesday i casually walk on by to find that you're not there ,
i act like i dont care .
but on friday i catch a glimpse of you i tell myself dont hesitate
you just walk up and say hello ! say hello !
i just want a chance to know you to know the woman deep inside.
yeah yeah (and)
i dont wanna look back on life to see this missed pooprtunity.
yeah yeah (to get to know you)
even at the rick of looking like a fool to you .
i just want a chance to know you to know the love you have inside ,
yeah yeah (and)
i dont wanna look back on life to see this missed opportunity .
yeah yeah
even at the risk of looking like a fool to you .
katrina will i ever know your heart ?
