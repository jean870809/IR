SC
You’ve never seen this side of me, eh?
No mind, No mind
No mind, No mind
Verse 1:
Sicka all these liars
Sicka getting ****ed ova
Sicka all these fake ass snakes swerving in the grass **** talking bout me
right behind my back
Making up stories bout how I spend my life
pure imagination
And all these people telling me what I’m supposed to do
like I give a damn,
Why they care so much
I could give 3 ****s what you think about me
Left, right, middle fingers to the haters try to ****in’ come and bring me down
From LA to Taipei and
Taipei to MA oh god
From people to people
They all feel the same oh god
Hook:
Yea, I pay em no mind
All these two-faced *****es tryna mess I pay em no mind
Got my back stabbed hard but still **** em pay em no mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
I pay em No mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
No mind, No mind
Verse 2:
These people I pretend to like
These shady facts they try to hide
They latch on me so ****in’ tight
like leeches tryna suck me dry
I ain’t rapping I’m just expressing some facts
Spit lyrical fessions that go with the rhymes
Emotions emotions man I just can’t hide,
I’mma go on an wreck em for 8 more bars time
Strangers be callin' me best friends
Force me to follow their instagram
can’t even correctly say my name, I’m mean
who the F are you pretending
I’m so sick of this **** man
Why am I putting up with this **** man
Who can I even trust in deez days man
Shut your ass and get outta my way man
But i look in the mirror and keep telling myself...
Hook:
Pay pay pay pay pay pay em no mind
All these two-faced *****es tryna mess I pay em no mind
Got my back stabbed hard but still **** em pay em no mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
I pay em no mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
No mind, No mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
I pay em No mind
Every single word you say bout me I pay em no mind
No mind, No mind
No mind, No mind
