Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And auld lang syne ?

For auld lang syne, my jo,
For auld lang syne,
Weâ€™ll tak a cup of kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.

For auld lange syne, my jo,
For auld lange syne,
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.
