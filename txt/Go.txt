radio,radio, play this song,
play this music all night long,
i want the world to know that nothing's wrong.
who needs to worry bout the rent,
(can't we just put it on a card),
when happens when the internet,
(can't tell where the solutions are)
the government don't shut you down,
(and 2012 is just a myth)
you shot yourself onto the ground,
(what do you plan on doing now)
chorus
put all your drama in a box, tape it up and go!
put all the troubles of the world up on Ebay and go!
i see the way you wanna break free and let it go!
i see your dreams are coming true and after tonight,
just keep your head up and
go! go! go!
everything is 2.0, go!
go! go! go!
everything that's in your dreams, everything is in your reach, go!
battery pull is too 08',
iphones don't reboot this way,
don't need a cigarette to get away from the drama
why don't you buy yourself a bag,
(can't we just put it on a card),
and save yourself a heart attack,
(can't tell where the solutions are)
the government don't shut you down,
(and 2012 is just a myth)
you shot yourself onto the ground,
(what do you plan on doing now)
chorus
put all your drama in a box, tape it up and go!
put all the troubles of the world up on Ebay and go!
i see the way you wanna break free and go!
i see your dreams are coming true and after tonight,
just keep your head up and
go! go! go!
everything is 2.0, go!
go! go! go!
everything that's in your dreams, everything is in your reach, go!
chorus
put all your drama in a box, tape it up and go!
put all the troubles of the world up on Ebay and go!
i see you waiting to exhale and you're ready to go!
i see your dreams are coming true and after tonight,
just keep your head up and
go! go! go!
everything is 2.0, go!
go! go! go!
everything that's in your dreams, everything is in your reach, go!
