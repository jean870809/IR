Never was a quitter so I ride on
19, more problems
Money callin' blowing up my iPhone
I'm the one to keep your eyes on
他們沒想到的時機開工
氣流旋轉超速二十級的颱風
地球奧秘沒時間一個個猜中
宇航員會探索未知的外太空
一飛衝天的高度 大氣層外失重
閉上眼睛我從來 沒做過白日夢
閉上眼睛我從來 只想往外直衝
有一天黃皮膚也能踏進白宮
All the bygones they can be the bygones
Surrounded by fear turn the lights on
I ain't got no option already been shut down
軟弱的每一面都要被光芒遮擋
I’m going down for real, down for real
I can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
Thought I gotta graduate but college ain't a place for me
Is the choice I had to make cuz I got somewhere else to be
他們不想讓我累了 不想讓我背著
不想讓我被焦慮擊碎 含著化了捧著不想讓我飛了
Done with finals, I’mma run back to a place called home
Long nights 16 hours flight across the time zones
Things changed when I ain’t here,
All the noises that  I  can’t hear
Stepping in the house shouting mama I’m home
But she moved out from the master bedroom
Don't judge me on my 3.9 report card
Please do that when I'm swervin' on my sports car
When I landed JFK my family fell  apart
But I come home and tell them how New York was
I’m going down for real, down for real
I can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
他們說的太多 情緒再失控
現在只想逃離這裡 做個白日夢
睜開眼睛我還是只想往外直衝
有一天黃皮膚也能踏進白宮
All the bygones they can be the bygones
Surrounded by fear now turn the lights on
I ain't got no option already been shut down
I’m going down for real
Ii can’t sleep I can’t sleep
Staying up all night
Wishing my life was not my life
I’m going down for real, down for real
Down down down down
Bygone Bygone
Down down down down
Bygone Bygone
