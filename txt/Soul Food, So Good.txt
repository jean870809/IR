I just woke up
Sky's dark and grey
Why can't i stop thinking about yesterday
Oh no coffee  can fix my darken mood
Right now right here  let's get some
Soul food so good
Add some pepper and some spicy
You need a little flaver in your rice
Soul food so good
so good i feel inside

And the flaver is taking me so high
You don't even need me to tell you
It's deep inside of your heart
Just let it go  just let it go
You know you can feel it
No way to stop it no way to fight it no way to high
Your feeling it with soul music
Your heart is pumpin' your head is movin'
Your body is groovin'
Your can't stop loving soul music

Now my sky the deepest blue
The music just woke me up I hope it wakes you too
Oh this feeling life is interlude
I need this music and I need some food
Soul food so good add some sugar and some spicy
You need a little flavor in your life
Soul food so good so good i feel inside
And the flavor is taking me so high
You don't even need me to tell you
It's something deep inside of your heart
Just let it go let it go you know you can feel it
No way to stop it no way to fight it no way to high
Your feeling it with soul music
Your heart is pumpin' your head is movin'
Your body is grooving
You're can't stop loving  soul music
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha
I love it baby
深入我的心愛上了他
Oh baby music is deep inside of your soul you know
No way to stop it no way to fight it no way to high
Your feeling it with soul music
Your heart is pumpin' your head is movin'
Your body is grooving
Your can't stop loving soul music
Soul food so good
Soul food so good
