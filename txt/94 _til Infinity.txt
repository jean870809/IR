Back, back back and forth (I'm ready)
If you love me, say it
Before I let you go
I wanna be down, oh baby
There's something going on at its best it is love
One hunnid percent, that Crystal Waters
Age ain't nothing but a number
Song ain't nothing without a beat
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
Don't it ever make you wonder
Gotta practice what you preach
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
I need some brand new heavies, brand new me
Dreaming on a dreamer, make u a believer
I wanna be down, oh baby
There's something going on at its best it is love
One hunnid per cent, that Crystal Waters
Age ain't nothing but a number
Song ain't nothing without a beat
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
Don't it ever make you wonder
Gotta practice what you preach
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
I got nothing but the radio on
The internet don't play my favorite song
Oh baby
Age ain't nothing but a number
Song ain't nothing without a beat
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
Don't it ever make you wonder
Gotta practice what you preach
Everyday of the week, 94 ‘til infinity
Age ain't nothing but a number
Song ain't nothing without a beat
Everyday of the week
94 ‘til infinity
Don't it ever make you wonder
Gotta practice what you preach
Everyday of the week, 94 ‘til infinity
