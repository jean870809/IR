I’ve been hit by stars
A beauty you are
A beauty you are
Day turns into night
You light up my dark
You light up my dark
you’re the one that I see,Waking up next to me
And I hope its the same for you
But you play with my mind, When you send me these signs
And I see other girls getting too
I wanna know , I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah
Where do we go, where do we go from here he-ay-yeah-a-yeah
Why you are you keeping me on hold
don’t wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or it no
I wanna know , I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah, hey a yeah a yeah
Diamonds in your eyes cover your lies
Trust me we can be special tonight，Special tonight
you’re the one that I see,Waking up next to me
And I hope its the same for you
But you play with my mind, When you send me these signs
And I see other girls getting too
I wanna know , I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah
Where do we go, where do we go from here he-ay-yeah-a-yeah
Why you are you keeping me on hold
don’t wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or it no
I wanna know , I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah, hey a yeah a yeah
Trust me we can be special tonight….special tonight
I wanna know, I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah ( I want you)
Where do we go, where do we go from here
Why you are you keeping me on hold
don’t wanna leave this place alone
Is it a yes or it no
I wanna know, I wanna know hey a yeah a yeah ..
