IQ and logic
May show you what to do

Kisses so sweet
The beautiful stuff of your soul
Jack always welcome
The magic that will roll
Before they wanna rock and roll

You'll see yeah
Slow oh oh from romance we roll

Flow oh oh through toughness we roll

Don't give up what you're looking for
So find a known and funny easy
Way to go oh

Demanding is you and your faith
Surrender right here
And you'd feel OK

Hey you in case you're alone

Rewrite your own rules
Enlighten your soul
