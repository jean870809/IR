I belong in the water
Take me to my escape
I can’t run no more
Sleep all of my troubles away
Light up the sea there’s no error
Our hearts swimming in the waves
You belong in the water
I know I’m your escape
Maybe we should just get high
Wake up like there’s no goodbye
Pour the salt on me and watch the ocean run wild
I’m feeling free tonight

I want a love underwater
Where no one can bother me
Don’t tell me you know what love is
The cure for this is the sea
Maybe we should just get high
Wake up like there’s no goodbye
Pour the salt on me and watch the ocean run wild
I’m feeling free tonight
When the sea hugs the shore like you’re hugging me
When the sea hugs the shore like you’re holding onto me
When the sea hugs the shore like you’re hugging me
When the sea hugs the shore like you’re holding onto me
Maybe we should just get high
Wake up like there’s no goodbye
Pour the salt on me and watch the ocean run wild
I’m feeling free tonight
Ooo I’m feeling free tonight
Ooo yeah
I belong in the water
Take me to my escape
