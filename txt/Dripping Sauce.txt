I’mma let you know
When you make me feel that vibe
Feel that vibe
Watch but don’t touch
You know this is what I’m like
What I’m like
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
Went to the bathroom took myself a photo
I like to twerk it back now they say Go Go
Killing everything don’t call the Po Po
Your man tried to holla I said No No
I know you see these diamonds on my neck
I just made it cold out in LA straight off the jet
Now I got that puma feeling can’t catch me I’m too fast
Give a dude my number
When he calls I’m like who this
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
The way I stack it up they tryna know know
I’ll be on the high I’m never low low
Your man keep following like he my Toto
He can’t get enough he wants some momo

I know you see these diamonds on my neck
I just made it cold out in LA straight off the jet
Now I got that puma feeling can’t catch me I’m too fast
Give a dude my number
When he calls I’m like who this

I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce

I’mma let you know
When you make me feel that vibe
Feel that vibe
Watch but don’t touch
You know this is what I’m like
What I’m like

I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce
I keep dripping dripping sauce
Dripping dripping sauce

I’mma let you know
When you make me feel that vibe
Feel that vibe
Watch but don’t touch
You know this is what I’m like
What I’m like

I’mma let you know
When you make me feel that vibe
Feel that vibe
Watch but don’t touch
You know this is what I’m like
What I’m like
