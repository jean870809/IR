Sometimes I need a little drama, spice up my life up
Keep calm and call yo mama, that ain't gonna work too long
21 got my life on check, what you think about that
No more guitar hero time to stack de niro
And the world's lot bigger
Than just you and me I'm just tryna live it all once
If you're thinking about it then you know you got it
Time to leave my 12 by 10, gotta be 1 not 10 no
L-o-v-e imma be henry counting them benjis
N-o-n-e ain't nobody gone be stopping me
L-o-v-e all my girls are here with me
G-o-a-t greatest of all time anyone can be yeah
These ******* are basic drama
I ain't tryna mess with that
You know how I roll
You know how I roll
And the world's lot bigger
Than just you and me,I'm just tryna live it all once
If you're thinking about it then you know you got it
Time to leave my 12 by 10, gotta be 1 not 10 no
L-o-v-e imma be henry counting them benjis
N-o-n-e ain't nobody gone be stopping me
L-o-v-e all my girls are here with me
G-o-a-t greatest of all time anyone can be yeah

And the world's lot bigger
Than just you and me im just tryna live it all once
If you're thinking about it then you know you got it
Time to leave my 12 by 10, gotta be 1 not 10 no
L-o-v-e imma be henry counting them benjis
N-o-n-e ain't nobody gone be stopping me
L-o-v-e all my girls are here with me
G-o-a-t greatest of all time anyone can be yeah
