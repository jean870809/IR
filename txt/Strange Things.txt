Look what you've done to me
It's hitting me hard countin' down from one to three
Falling right quick I’mma tell ya honestly
If you all about the rush then you could come to me
Wishing you forever stuck in hell
Nobody around when you cry for help
Flesh-burning smoke in the air, deep inhale
Icy touch on that Gucci belt, so real
生來服侍原罪的奴才
深夜更別控制欲望的獨裁
推我下水那就不要拉我出來
愉悅神經遞質瞬間把我覆蓋
一切生人請勿靠近聖人除外
好奇心像蘋果一口把人毒害
Know you’re here to live your life-ah
So do it do it do what you like -ah
Oh between right and wrong
What am I gonna do
I can’t stay away from you
Oh guess I am not that strong
No matter what I choose
I am always gonna lose
Fly off the bridge in your second Maserati
Freeze in the camera then drop like Kamikaze
你愛的他們全部人都去了哪裡
打扮得精心華麗 二十世紀的party
可你已經站在另一邊
很多時間摸不到世界的另一面
I ain't sorry about that I can't get you what you want
I ain't sorry bout what you become
生來服侍原罪的奴才
深夜更別控制欲望的獨裁
推我下水那就不要帶我出來
愉悅神經遞質瞬間把我覆蓋
一切生人請勿靠近聖人除外
好奇心像蘋果一口把人毒害
Know you’re here to live your life-ah
So do it do it do what you like -ah
Oh between right and wrong
What am I gonna do
I can’t stay away from you
Oh guess I am not that strong
No matter what I choose
I am always gonna lose
忘記你沒打夠的賭
忘記你沒跳夠的舞
忘記你從來沒走完的那條路
問你是否從沒想被人記得住
忘記你沒打夠的賭
忘記你沒跳夠的舞
忘記你從來沒走完的那條路
問你是否從沒想被人記得住
Oh…
I am always gonna lose
Oh between right and wrong
What am I gonna do
I can’t stay away from you
Oh guess I am not that strong
No matter what I choose
I am always gonna lose
