Iʼm a boss thatʼs a fact
Kill the scene get a check
Hit the club blow some racks
When I smack it girl it better bounce back
She want the dawgs in the night
Donʼt wanna cuff just wanna pipe
Cold world but thatʼs just life
You want the love whatʼs the price

It seems like all these girls want it like that
Want it like that
Yeah yeah
It seems like all these girls wanna ball out
‘til itʼs all gone yeah yeah
It seems like these girls want it like that
Itʼs nothing they wonʼt do to get there
It seems like all these girls want it like that
Want it like that yeah yeah
Iʼm in Traipei, I hit New York
Itʼs all the same, just keep it going
Just like Lebron Iʼm calling shots
Imma ball and get it till I drop
They need this life from me
Itʼs only one night on me
Donʼt check the cost Iʼm going in
And tomorrow we do it all again

I know she love it she want it all
She want the bags we hit the mall
I tryna go she keep me coming
She ainʼt fxxking witcha boy jus for none
I can do it all day
He an amateur, who管你是誰
They can never reach the bar check the score
This is why these canʼt ignore Iʼm a god

It seems like all these girls want it like that
Want it like that
Yeah yeah
It seems like all these girls wanna ball out
‘til itʼs all gone yeah yeah
It seems like these girls want it like that
Itʼs nothing they wonʼt do to get there
It seems like all these girls want it like that
Want it like that yeah yeah
Iʼm in Traipei, I hit Tokyo
Itʼs all the same, just keep it going
Just like Lebron Iʼm calling shots
Imma ball and get it till I drop
They need this life from me
Itʼs only one night on me
Donʼt check the cost Iʼm going in
And tomorrow we do it all again

It seems like all these girls want it like that
Want it like that
Yeah yeah
