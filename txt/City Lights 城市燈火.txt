City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
不得不說日子過得太快
顛倒黑白動作慢半拍
禮物或ZD都拆開
到底黎明還會不會再來
有點麻木沒太多感觸
不能馬虎舞步再反覆
你從哪來 沒有人在乎也沒有人猜別覺得太奇怪
Thought I told you bout it but you really didn't listen
Don't tryna drain me of my energy
I'm a magician
Ain't a damn thing changed I'm on a mission
Shine bright like a diamond
need no permission
They said the world is yours
have some faith in me lord
Let me do my thing don't try to save me lord
I ain't going nowhere you know where to take me lord
That's the reason why
please you gotta to stay with me lord
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
I’m looking through the window
and Im looking for the city lights
Been blinded by the hate by the fake
fighting every night
Man I'm sipping so much henny
and I only trust a few not too many
Call my girl tell her Ima see my granny
cause nothing in this life is more than family
Honestly I don’t really know nothing
All I know is that i gotta keep running
Far away from here far away from here
You don’t know my pain
u don’t know the years
All the sweat and the blood now
To all the homies who been gone now
It took time but I’m here now
It took time but we're here now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
City lights don’t sleep
City lights don’t sleep now
City lights don’t sleep
Cause they got a hold on me now
