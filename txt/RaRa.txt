Show me what you want
Said I won't let you go
Funny when we fighting all I want is taking you home
Every time you run away got nothing in my soul
Baby all I wanna say
Call me crazy
Tell me where you go

Baby all I wanna say
Call me crazy
Tell me where you go
Baby all I wanna say

Show me what you want
Said I won't let you go
Funny when we fighting all I want is taking you home
Every time you run away got nothing in my soul
Baby all I wanna say
Call me crazy
Tell me where you go

Show me what you want
Said I won't let you go
Funny when we fighting all I want is taking you home
Every time you run away got nothing in my soul
Baby all I wanna say
Call me crazy
Tell me where you go
