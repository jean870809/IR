Looking my eyes in the sky
You know I'll give you a surprise
When I saw you at first time
You came into my heart
Something you don't know at all at all at all
Something you don't know at all at all
Looking my eyes in the sky
You know I'll give you a surprise
When I saw you at first time
You came into my heart
Something you don't know at all at all at all
Something you don't know at all at all
I am your sea
I'm your sky
I'll always by your side
You never know but you can feel it when you want
So wonderful
