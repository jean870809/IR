Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
She told me go ahead and do it
That’s what my excuse is
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
I’ll just find a way to prove it
Tell them fellas hustle hard get money
30 50 100 stacks gon hand it on me
Tennie weenie on the money honey hungry
Bunny got 18 karats run them pockets
Oh you gotta love it
When girls do it like me
Dinner with me veggies only
Hate it greasy boy
Dolour ain’t enough you gotta stunt
Like Drizzy boy像說唱歌手Dizzy一樣
But I ain’t gonna go for Jumpman over Yeezy
I’ll wipe your brows off if you dare me
I’ll shoot your mouth off
Don’t get near me
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
She told me go ahead and do it
That’s what my excuse is
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
I’ll just find a way to prove it
That’s my story stick into it
閉上眼看得見的看不見的
都無故失蹤
在我腦海裡頭旋轉跳躍
再逐步升空
Make it bounce like ping-pong
Bake an ounce trap queen
I undo all her filters got
Her super mad like King Kong
就讓我肆意妄為
一步步擴大勢力範圍
做自己從沒質疑上誰
就這樣坐上我的首位
像停不下來的軸承
讓ducati(摩托)剎不住油門
You see me heel to 50
像給Coco走秀的劉雯
She fresh off that runway
Coco helmut lang and Gucci
You’ll see me on the front row
But now I just want a sushi
維持美麗沒時間和你質疑
對不起
學習練就一身絕技
喂飽你們肚皮
Coco made me do it
我不再找其他藉口
Coco made me do it
守株待兔叢林獵手
But we didn’t really do it
我也從未混跡街頭
Oh I might Othello
今天叫你放學別走
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
She told me go ahead and do it
That’s what my excuse is
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
Coco made me do it
Coco Coco made me do it
I’ll just find a way to prove it
That’s my story stick into it
