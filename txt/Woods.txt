I took her into the woods
Said baby no more drama
Won't you stop stop lying lying to yourself
Won't you stop stop talking to me
Karma karma coming for me
Got me looking like a psycho, I ain’t releasing her tomorrow
她說不可能不開口
沒有辦法放手讓我能夠抬頭
Sitting on the ground I finished all these bottles
She wanna know my secret, Alright, alright
I keep her hands tied all night,
why tho why tho,why tho don’t ask me why tho no no
I don’t really want us both,  she didn’t know
這一切的發生的背後
不會沒有預謀
Deep in the woods
I left her Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
I left her Deep in the woods
快停止賣弄
要經受皮肉之苦是不是你才懂
She ain't gonna snitch on nobody
She said when you come around you know where to find me
I might just hurt you right now no one’s gonna hear you no no
Looking so harmless but I could be dangerous
I ain't scared of sinning though treacherous oh
So sure I deserve whatever she got on her
But I ain’t no murderer, no murderer
Diamond ring, whole lot of paper and a good good good good reputation
Deep in the woods
I left her Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
I left her Deep in the woods
其實你或許真的找對了人
我的秘密有時我會忘記為了神
有時我和她扮演的就是同一人
不僅是你我也和你一樣慌了神
