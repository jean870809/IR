#1 spot I gotta have it

I do it well 24/7 bro I ain't bragging
Look I'm in the cut cooking
Then it's lights camera action

A plus game mayne
Give shorty some satisfaction

Red lights I be passing em
Stack them checks I'm cashing em
They can't hang I'm outlasting em
Way over the limit surpassing em
Crown on top of the dome I got it
Rubber band stack up in the pocket
Light it up and burn it burn it down then watch me drop it

Let's hit 'em with that new ew

Get this bread yes that's what we gon' do oo

End of the day it's just me and my crew ew

Never get enough
Yeah I'm forever #1

So watch me
Drop it drop it

Number 1 gotta have it
So drop it drop it
Ain't nobody can stop me
I go drop it drop it

No you can't stop it
So Just drop it drop it

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level
Let's hit 'em with that new ew

Get this bread yes thats what we gon' do oo

End of the day it's just me and my crew ew

Never get enough
Yeah I'm forever #1

So watch me
Drop it drop it
Number 1 gotta have it

So drop it drop it

Ain't nobody can stop me
I go drop it drop it

No you can't stop it
So just drop it drop it

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level

Get on my level
