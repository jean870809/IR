Summer time
And the living is easy

Fish are jumping

And the cotton is high

And your daddy is rich

And your mama is good looking

So hush little baby

Don't you cry

So hush little baby

Don't you cry come on

I'm taking my freedom

Pulling it off the shelf

Putting it on my chain

I wear it around my neck

I'm taking my freedom
Putting it in my car
Wherever I choose to go

It will take me far
I'm living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden

I'm living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living your life like it's golden

I'm taking my own freedom
Putting it in my stroll
Singing loud and strong

Grooving all day long
Strumming my own freedom

Putting it in my stroll
I'll be high stepping
You all letting the joy unfold
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden
Living my life like it's golden

Living my life like it's golden
Golden golden golden golden
Golden golden

I'm taking my own freedom
Can't take it from me
I was born into it
It comes naturally
I'm strumming my own freedom

Playing the god in me
Representing his glory oh yeah

Oh yeah oh yeah

Living my life
Padget come on

Living my life

I'm living my life
One more time

Living your life

Like it's freedom
