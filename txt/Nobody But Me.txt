Tried for weeks
nothing will losen the grip you hold
I’m learning your ways
oh you love keeping me on my toes
cuz there’s no light
now there’s no sound
I guess I’ll howl alone
and you were light
now there’s no us
so who’ve we got to hold?
cuz there ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
nobody, baby
that will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
no body, baby
will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
There ain’t nobody

we’re undone
both of us stubborn like a stone
taking a run
but something in me wants to crawl back home

cuz there’s no light
now there’s no sound
I guess I’ll howl alone
and you were light
now there’s no us
so who’ve we got to hold?
cuz there ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
nobody, baby
will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
nobody, baby
will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
There ain’t nobody

We’re undone
We’re undone

cuz there ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
nobody, baby
will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
ain’t nobody, body
that’ll look at you all night
completely satisfied
and who won’t give the fight
nobody, baby
will lay upon your chest
that’s giving you the best
no
There ain’t nobody
