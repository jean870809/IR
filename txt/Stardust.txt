I could be staring at somebody new
But stuck in my head is a picture of you
You were the thunder I was the rain
I wanna know if I’ll see you again
I said I love you, you said goodbye
Everything changes in the blink of an eye
It’s been a while, I still carry the flame
I wanna know if I’ll see you again
See you again
See you again
Want you to know
What you mean to me
What would it take
Take you to see
I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
And I wanna know if I'll see you again
Will I see you again
I feel like a fool
'Cause you're not even there
I'm writing this song
And you don't even care
Throw me a life Iine
And open the door
And pick up my heart
that you left on the floor
On the floor
On the floor
Want you to know
What you mean to me
What would it take
Take you to see
I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
And I wanna know if I'll see you again
Funny how the time goes rushing by
And all the little things we leave behind
But even then in everything I do
Is a little bit of me
and a little bit of you
When will I see you again
When will I see you again

When will I see you again
When will I see you again
I could put a little stardust in your eyes
Put a little sunshine in your life
Give me a little hope you feel the same
And I wanna know if I'll see you again
See you again
When will I see you again

When will I see you again
