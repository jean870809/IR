I wake up every morning
Im smiling when the coffee drips,
A splash of milk and brown sugar, one stir before it touch my lips
But lately something don't taste right
And my daily routine is off
Keeping me up all night
It's only 9am with the whole day ahead of me
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
Im feelin your style , feeling your heart,
Glued to ya vibe, nothing'll pull us apart,
With our mind *** we ain't gotta take our clothes off yet
Not sure whats next but Its YOU ill protect
With all of this depth… and respect,
You give me everything but debt, I'm impressed
TLC with each step ...your my left… eye forever,
So no matter the weather our tears fall together
I see you carry burdens, your raising the bar
Now that our timings aligning I'll lift some weight off your heart.
Ugh..lemme make you happy while theres still time left,
Gimme a few more hours, we’ll make these moments timeless...
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
When you look at me the moments freeze,
A polaroid in time... just you and me
And When every Minute ticks away
And every second ends the day,
I feel like holding on
But is it good to be true
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
I don't want to, keep feeling like im into you
Wish I could just get through even if its just one day
Like 24 hours without you
