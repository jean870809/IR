She so hot 像雜誌上的 model
So dame hot 這一次 絕對不會讓你走
準備好跟你邂逅 瘋狂的全面失控
女孩想要
Take control take control
Let it go go go go hun
She like that party rock
Let me touch that I can't stop
粉色 bikini
Make me so crazy
飛得越來越高
Lamborghini
Drinks on me I'm top on you
I'm too fly come fly with me
Put my shades on put my swag on
Put your hands in the air party rock with me

Come be my lady 女孩
你是我的菜 baby 讓我放得開 girl

So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air

Like you just don't care
So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air

Club banger 心是飛的
飛得太快 hater 在我後面追著

Let's go let's go

Party people get yo ass on the floor on the floor

愛上你的美 想要認識
