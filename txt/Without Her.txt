What can I do without her

Where can I go without her

What do I know without her

I should have been told without her

I will feel this way

I will feel feel feel this way I will feel feel feel this way

I will feel feel feel this way I will feel feel feel this way

Oh I never mind刪除情感單身無害
Don't mind I never mind

時間的海重新再來

探究萬物愛的源起

兩個黑洞互相吸引

你看日蝕了難得一見的絕色
你看日蝕了你會不會捨不得
I think I deserve it

What can I do without her

Where can I go without her

What do I know without her

I should have been told without her

I will feel this way feel feel feel this way

I will feel this way feel feel feel this way

I will feel this way

Oh I never mind這一個人與我無關

Don't mind I never mind最深的愛也最傷害

探究萬物愛的消弭

想見不能見是酷刑

你看日蝕了難得一見的絕色
你看日蝕了黑洞全境擴散著
你看日蝕了你會不會捨不得
I think I deserve it

What can I do without her

Where can I go without her

What can I do without her

Where can I go without her

What do I know without her

I should have been told without her

I will feel this way feel feel feel this way

I will feel this way feel feel feel this way

I will feel this way feel feel feel this way

I will feel feel feel this way

I will feel this way
