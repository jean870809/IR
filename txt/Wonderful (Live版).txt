Looking my eyes in the sky
You know I'll give you a surprise
Every sight that you have take
It's always been in my mind
Something you don't know at all at all at all
Something you don't know at all at all
Looking my eyes through your tears
You know I'll give you a surprise
Every sight that you have take
It's always been in my mind
Something you don't know at all at all at all
Something you don't know at all at all
I'm your sea
I'm your sky
I'll always by your side
You never know but you can feel it when you want
So wonderful
So wonderful
Looking my eyes through your tears
You know I'll give you a surprise
Every sight that you have take
It's always been in my mind
Something you don't know at all at all at all
Something you don't know at all at all
