I ain’t nothing like them eh
I ain’t got no real friends eh
I’ve been waiting for the moment when the world ends
Before that I’mma get myself another million
My obsession with my depression mixing well with my confession to god
It’s a blessing to get attention but I’ll be far from perfection now too far
I’ll be always on my own I’ll be down to ride
In the city back in China I bring some bad lil vibes
I’mma kick it every minute that my good life
I’mma be the only one that’s gonna do it do it right
now I ….
無數夜晚輾轉反側難以入睡
My mind on the highway

But I ain’t gonna stay with ya
My obsession with my depression mixing well with my confession to god
It’s a blessing to get attention
But I’ll be far from perfection now too far
I’ll be always on my own I’ll be down to ride
In the city back in China I bring some bad lil vibes
I’mma kick it every minute that my good life
I’mma be the only one that’s gonna do it do it right
now I ….
I’m thinking thinking about what I got
I’m sinking sinking but that’s on god
I’m thinking thinking about what I got
I’m sinking sinking but that’s on god
My obsession with my depression mixing well with my confession to god
It’s a blessing to get attention
But I’ll be far from perfection now too far
Lil life   Lil lil lil life
Lil life   Lil lil lil life
Lil life   Lil lil lil life
Now I
Good life
Good good lil life eh eh
I’ll be always on my own I’ll be down to ride
In the city back in China I bring some bad lil vibes
Imma kick it every minute that my good life
Imma be the only one that’s gonna do it do it right
now I ….
