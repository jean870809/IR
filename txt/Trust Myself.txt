Underneath the covers I see ghosts
Lying with the aftermath in the ashes
I keep killing **** in tryna grow grow
Drive my heart in automatic it’s a habit
But I still want that fire in my bones
If I can’t trust myself with love
Then how’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
Hasn’t my heart already been bled enough
How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
With love with love with love
If all these broken planets could align
I wouldn’t be here holding piece ancient ruins
Swearing that my luck is in decline
I’m walking into open waters
Push me through it
But I still want that fire in my bones
If I can’t trust myself with love
Then how’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
Hasn’t my heart already been bled enough
How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
With love with love with love
以愛還愛
All these secrets I’m just keeping in a drawer now
I’ve been looking for a way to break the door down
It happens to people emotions the deep
Is it hopeless? How’m I supposed to breathe
If I can’t trust myself with love
(How can I trust myself with love)
Then How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
Hasn’t my heart already been bled enough
How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
If I can’t trust myself with love
(How can I trust myself with love)
Then How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
Hasn’t my heart already been bled enough
How’m I supposed to trust somebody else with love
With love with love with love
Love Love Love
I am gonna trust somebody hey
I am gonna trust somebody like you
