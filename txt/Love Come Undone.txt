There is a candle and it’s always burning
There is a light but I cannot go home
Lost in the world so cold
Losing my faith in love
I, I’ll never find love in here no more
Tuck me down and tuck my heart to the floor
Take my breath away
Take what's left away
Love come undone
There is a candle and it’s always burning
The world's so cold but it's always turning
Stuck in the world alone
Yeah……
I, I’ll never find love in here no more
Tuck me down and tuck my heart to the floor
Take my breath away
Take what's left away
Love come undone
Love come undone
Hoo……
