All these blurry nights feel the same to me

Last night I lost all my patience
You were ****** up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more
No more
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh-oh
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Make it make sense
Make it make sense, I
Can't hide a heart in a black tint, I
You were off the bull**** and the tablets
Under 21, both savage
Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you going to blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober (Hey)
I'm the one you call when you feel alone
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rock star crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all my love
Last night I lost all my patience
You were ****** up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more no more
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh-oh
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh-oh
Eh, uh, eh, eh, uh
Been a minute since I heard you wanna stay as friends
I learned from my mistakes, you made me want to learn again
I don't really see the problem, it's a risk I wanna take
You say let's see where it goes but I don't really wanna wait
Look and listen up
You was smiling when we ****
Let's not even think about it
We ain't gotta talk a lot
Make it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jam's on, I wanna see you make it pop, ay
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ay
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ay
Imma treat you good like you've been waiting for your turn, ay
Nothing in the universe feel better than your tongue, ay
Bouta go home I know you finna come with
I'm playing these games like a pimp on the strip
Conversations late night about how we gonna live
I don't got the answer to it, all I finna say is..
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh-oh
**** the rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh
Rules-oh-oh-oh-oh
當光灑進了 white Porsche
I never felt so good
Call me DJ NoNo
Oh oh no 播放列表歌很夠
你點頭我心裡會滿足
博物館給了更多感悟
在天文臺半山道漫步
拼LA夜景的版圖
**** the rules
距離不是問題 I know
為了這一刻的feel我
值得飛了那麼久 She look so pretty
I wanna a kiss 把Beautiful memory
存入了我的iPhone X
I I I hope 24 hour can become 48
看日落 粉的天 有藍月亮陪
想要擁抱 你在我需要前給
Sunny gone i don't care
You are my sunshine babe
I don't feel control
Better on my own
I'm used to being so gone for way too long
Long
Long
Rules, rules, rules
