Tia:
Yeah,I happen to get real drunk
One drink turned to shots and I lost count

Iʼve been kind of down on my luck
Donʼt know how my friends got me out of this house
But now I sound silly, now I sound stupid

My sentences are broken and my words are getting fluid
So if youʼre listening now,
Just stop while youʼre ahead, please

Kehlani:
Because I made a fool of myself in the past five minutes

And now Iʼm yelling at the phone
In the middle of the bar, begging for your kisses

Tia:
It’s just my luck I caught your machine

Kehlani
It’s just my luck you ainʼt pick up for me

Tia:
It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember this in the morning

Kehlani:
It’s just my luck I called you at three

Tia:
It’s just my luck that you went to sleep

Kehlani:
It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember this in the morning

Tia:
I could just let go of my phone no~ no~ no~no~no~ you and I

Kehlani:
So now Iʼm onto something sweet

There’s vodka in my third *** on the beach
I donʼt know how Iʼm still standing on my feet

Plus I donʼt look a thing like my fake ID
So now Iʼm feeling silly Now Iʼm feeling stupid
My sentences are slurring
And my words get quite confusing
So if you are listening now
Go on and stop while youʼre ahead, ahead

Tia:
Because I made a fool of myself for the past five minutes

And now Iʼm yelling at the phone
In the middle of the bar, begging for your kisses

Kehlani: It’s just my luck I caught your machine

Tia: It’s just my luck you ainʼt pick up for me

Kehlani: It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember this in the morning

Tia: It’s just my luck I called you at three

Kehlani: It’s just my luck that you went to sleep

Tia: It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember you in the morning

Tia: Cuz it’s just my luck

Tia&Kehlani: It’s just my luck I caught your machine

Tia: It’s just my luck you ainʼt pick up for me(Kehlani: you ain’t pick up for me)

Tia: It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember this in the morning (Kehlani: I won’t remember a single thing in the morning baby~)

Tia&Kehlani: It’s just my luck I called you at three
Tia&Kehlani: It’s just my luck that you went to sleep
Tia&Kehlani: It’s just my luck I wonʼt remember this in the morning (Kehlani: so so so lucky~)


Tia:We could just let go oh oh oh ~ no~ no~ no~no~no~ you and I

Tia&Kehlani:We could just let go oh oh oh ~ no~ no~ no~no~no~ you and I
