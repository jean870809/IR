Life repeats again and again just like spinning wheels
And it's like everyday for the morning bus
As I almost fall asleep you coming and sitting by me
The electricity goes through my body is going to shout
What a strange world to make me feel so crazy
What a strange love to make me feel so real
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
Work repeats again and again just like broken dream
And it's going every way but the one I want
What a strange world to make me feel so crazy
What a strange love to make me feel so real
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
Woo woo woo
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
This is a love just like chemical
I had a dream and I make it beautiful
And you now take my breath away
Woo woo woo
