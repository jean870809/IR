I've been here before can’t you see how it all started
Tell me something I know
Something only I know
We've been going round and around in circles
Baby I was blinded
I think I'm going crazy
（I think I'm going crazy）

I think I'm going..

Crazy
（I think I'm going）
I think I'm going crazy
（I think I'm going crazy）
