Same bed
But it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio
But it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all
That it does is just tear me down
Cause My heart breaks a little
When i hear your name
And it all just sounds like uh uh uh
Mmm too young too dumb to realize
That i should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all My hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now My baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride My ego
My needs and My selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you
To walk out My life
Now I'll never
Never get to clean up the mess I made
And it haunts me
Every time I close My eyes
It all just sounds like uh uh uh uh
Too young too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all My hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now My baby is dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for My mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
Cause I remember
How much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
