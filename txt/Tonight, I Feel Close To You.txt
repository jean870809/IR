Close my eyes and feel your mind
Time has passed
I walk like a shadow
Never knew what I am going through
You touch my heart and take my breath away
Whisper on the wind so softly
Let the bright stars fill our dreams with love
Reach for your hand (You're holding my key)
And you show me the way
Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
I wish we could stay forever as one
All the tears that haunt my past
You promised it'll be better tomorrow
Play that song
You and I listened to
And let it gently ease our pain
Tender rain drops from the blue skyaa
Flowers blooming, life is so divine
Like sunlight on a stream (You're holding my key)
You show the world to me
Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
So much love in this beautiful world
Search for the brightest star in the sky
You will find the meaning of love
Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
Just be yourself (Just be yourself)
We need this love... I've never knew
Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
I wish we could stay forever as one
