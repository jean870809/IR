男：

Those mother ******* can't hold me back
Hell ya I'mma about to kill this track
How you like that
Just like that
重新開始 現在我回來
心是飛的 目標我對著
狗仔追著Stunna 我呸著
這一路上有很多Haters
他們繼續追著
I'mma see y'all later uhh

I'mma turn it up
Let's make it up
I'mma walk it up
What you going up
今晚誰也別想
Hold us down

How you like me now baby

You think you cool really

Don't tryna **** with me
Ready set go baby
女：
Don't play the game with me
因為你 輸不起
Don't try to mess with me
不想聽 對不起
別怪我 沒有警告過你
這陷阱
Go to war with me

男：
Those mother ******* can't hold me back

Hell ya I'mma about to kill this track

Me and Bassjackers on this track

Those mother ******* can't hold us back

Money fame honey
我不在意
他們對我先入為主
因為我的背景
You can't touch me now
最多只能看背影
Now all eye on me
我做我自己
Hey

I really don't care
I really don't care
I really don't care
Don't stop Bassjackers let the beat drop

今晚誰也別想
Hold us down

How you like me now baby
