The way I go through with red roses burn my eyes.
Cold rain starts pouring hard, I'm being called upon.
Never let you go, it's why I did them all.
For a chance at least, to live in your way.
Love of you is my most cherished thing.
So stay alive, bravely.

I wish I could wake from the dream each time I dream.
There's a long night coming soon，I'd shine as the last shine.
Never let you go，it's why I did them all.
For a chance at least, to live in your way.
Love of you is my most cherished thing.
So stay alive, bravely.

Never let you go，it's why I did them all.
For a chance at least, to live in your way.
Love of you is my most cherished thing.
So stay alive, bravely.
