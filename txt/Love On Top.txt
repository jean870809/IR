We about to get up on this thing
The times is now
What you waiting for
It's time for you to get up and show the world
what we had in store
Some people have to stand in line
To get up in this place
Time is surely hard
Pick up your gun in this crazy race
Bring the beat in
Honey' honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Everybody asks me why
I'm smiling out from ear to ear
But I know
Nothing's perfect but it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
Finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives you all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
whoo Come on Baby
Top' top' top' top' top
You put my love on top
Ooo Come on baby
Top' top' top' top' top
Baby baby
I can hear the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again' and again' and again and again
But I know
Nothing's perfect' but it's worth it
After fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives you all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooo Come on Baby
Top' top' top' top' top
You put my love on top
Ooo Come on baby
Top' top' top' top' top
Baby it's you
You're  the one I love
Come on
(Baby it's you you're  the one I love)
Baby it's you
You're the one I need
You you're the one I love
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always calls
When I need you baby everything stops
Finally you put my love on top
Baby You're the one that I love
You're the only one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
Come on baby it's you
Love love love on top
