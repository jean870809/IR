Five Stars
Higher gang
What you talkin’ about
Wack s**t fake s**t sorry I don’t get it
Sit you’re a*s down just look how we make it
I know I’m best rapper since I was 20
I don’t wanna hear it cuz you’re dirty
I be like birdman I’m a bird
I don’t know it but I can learn
I just wanna money I swear

I swear I swear I going too deep
I'm 內行人 你還不屬於
買AP 恆寶 百達翡麗
鑲滿天星的鑽 瑞士的工藝
You never see Chinese drippin ok
I got ideal I never obey
**** what you think keep talking about me
有我在的公司會永不倒閉

One punch man 我給你臉上一拳
所有人嚇的都爬到一邊
我氣的青筋快要爆裂
我像你的剋星 見到你就一頓狂扁
我繼續冒險 我不停的升級
你說什麼聽不見
好多個閃光點 脖子上掛滿了珍珠得項鏈
So comfortable露出笑臉


My feet don't part in my Rick Owens
Why'd I tip toe with my big toe and
Scary psychosis like scarecrow and
I match your head like a hair sewing

Hide and seek where is your hair
Like Dora make the AK solid cus I’m all devoted
Camp be myself cause the boys encoded
My flow gets you going like locomotive

Deaf *****, watch your step *****
How I hold a pistol
Probably like a ***** got a millionaire wrist (ouch ouch)
Higher predicted it you should count a ***** album *****
Hotter the ***** sauce hit the beat like its a ****** one punch man fist woosh


(Ayo, how the ****
Y'all gonna let this ***** Ski Mask drop some fire s**t
And ya'll ****** think he gonna eat that, nah son nah b
It ain’t goin out like that)

Keep a 45 no colt
****** get the runnin like they Usain Bolt
Give a ***** wings give a ***** red bull
If a ***** die then I might be deadpool

5 to your face like I'm Abraham Lincoln
I leave a hole that's the size of a penny
When I catch that they gonna say that it’s Denny
Pay off the winners they say I'm at Denny's

Call me Goku,
I play the numbers just like Sudoku
Triple c rolls they get hella opals
Overpay the ***** I'm goin postal

I dressed to kill and y'all ****** formal
Magic on me trick I'm double door
Open your back up you lookin like Bulbasaur
***** I'm tyrannical, goin Tyrannosaurus stupid
That ***** you know that's a metaphor

Super Saiyan Hokage Ninja in my heart
Naruto Goku you weak as cold food
Murder you like cutting tofu
大搖大擺得我走在人民南路
普通人也看不懂我這個態度
Higher gang的vibe 除了兄弟財富什麼都不在乎

Higher gang swag young rapper don’t know how to be a man
Purple fire purple juice swag in studio B
Still be the whole lot of money dance
Blessing blessing flexing
Flexing h*e many fashion flow yeah
Endangered animal yeah became
International **** no love cash only

You need pay I'm VVIP free
有一點累 賺的錢翻了幾倍
Dunk from three I’m running my way
Too many different place you need face to face
