I can’t think no more
Don’t even know what to do no more
And I think you should know
This ain’t about me and you no more
And everything we said fell apart
Was it a dream I should’ve woken up
This paradise we thought we were in
Left me stranded here and I
I need you now
Can’t get my head straight baby tell me how
I need you now
It isn’t hard but we can’t work it out
I need you now
I shouldn’t be so selfish but I
I need you now
Thought it was you for sure
I never doubted us before
Is this a pause I should have known
Lost in blurry eyes I tried
And everything we said fell apart
Was it a dream I should’ve woken up
This paradise we thought we were in
Left me stranded here and I
I need you now
Can’t get my head straight baby tell me how
I need you now
It isn’t hard but we can’t work it out
I need you now
I shouldn’t be so selfish but I
I need you now
Was it a dream oh baby
It seems so real I can’t see
Was it a dream oh baby
It seems so real I can’t see
I need you now
Can’t get my head straight baby tell me how
I need you now
It isn’t hard no no oh
I need you now
I shouldn’t be so selfish but I
I need you now
