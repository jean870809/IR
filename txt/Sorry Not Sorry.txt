Why you acting a fool

I'm here keeping my cool
Yes I'm finally up in this *****

I put in work it's part of my groove

Dealing with all these haters

I'm the one seeing this through
Just mind your own you better get your own
You know I'm here cuz that's what I choose
Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry

Why you acting a fool
I'm here keeping my cool
Yes I'm finally up in this *****
I put in work it's part of my groove
Dealing with all these haters tryna get a piece of my food
Mind your own better get your own
I'm here cuz that's what I choose

Stuck in a maze running from back in the days

Top of my grind I fienda get paid ahead of my time

Flashy lights red carpet I'm feeling right

Champagne in the air
Yeah I'ma get it on tonight right cuz
Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry

I say sorry I'm not sorry

Sorry I'm not sorry
Sorry I'm not sorry
