Baby, when I try to tell you bout my feelings
It’s harder than I ever could imagine
My heart has never been this way before
Like it’s bleeding out my bones like it’s melting down
Baby the world I thought I knew about was changing
It’s painted with a color that’s so shining
My heart has never been this way before
From the bottom of my soul I can hear the drumming
Why don’t you just tell me that you love me so
It would be easier for me to fall deep in love
Heaven please just tell me which way to go
Should I go with the flow or should I take it slow?

Am I the only one that’s lost in all this madness?
Only one that’s caught up in this craziness
Cause baby when you put your arms on me
I can feel the heat
Am I the only one that’s lost in all this madness?
Only one that’s caught up in this craziness
Cause baby when you put your arms on me
I can feel the heat
Baby, when I try to tell you bout my feelings
It’s harder than I ever could imagine
My heart has never been this way before
Like it’s bleeding out my bones like it’s melting down
Baby the world I thought I knew about was changing
It’s painted with a color that’s so shining
My heart has never been this way before
From the bottom of my soul I can hear the drumming
Why don’t you just tell me that you love me so
It would be easier for me to fall deep in love
Heaven please just tell me which way to go
Should I go with the flow or should I take it slow?
Am I the only one that’s lost in all this madness?
Only one that’s caught up in this craziness
Cause baby when you put your arms on me
I can feel the heat
Am I the only one that’s lost in all this madness?
Only one that’s caught up in this craziness
Cause baby when you put your arms on me
I can feel it coming
Baby, when you try to tell me that you love me
It’s like I have never been so happy
so happy
