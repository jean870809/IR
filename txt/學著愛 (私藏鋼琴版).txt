You are my love
The window snow at night
The summer morning lights
The wake up call at night
You are my soul
You are the moon at night
You are my power to fight
And I will be right here
Cause you are my love
And I will love you
My morning sunshine
I'm waiting here for you
Cause you are my love
And I'll keep waiting here tonight
Keep on going
Keep on going for tonight
Cause you are my love
Oh oh oh
Cause you are my love
