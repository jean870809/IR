Tell me what you want
I’ll give you all I have
Now and forever
you make me insane I’ll take all the pain and the madness
Whatever goes down down down down down
Love you forever I’ll always be around

Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong
Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong

Take my …
Take my …
I’ll still be strong

Take my …
Take my …
I’ll still be strong

I’ll be whatever you need me to be
I’ll sing whatever you want me to sing

Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong
Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong

Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong
Take my love and run
I’ll still be strong

Take my …
Take my …
I’ll still be strong

Take my …
Take my …
I’ll still be strong
