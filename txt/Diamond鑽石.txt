I flex hard I'm a diamond
Crush me all you want
Imma take no damage
Bling bling bling
That's how I be doing
You could call me HP
Printing paper by the minute
We going big
Reppin FP yeah we down
With this business
Tracks go flame when I'm in it
Diamond
Diamond

Young OZI right here
Check check
給我好好聽著
這個環境壞了
真的壞的太扯 god damn
Bout time to 改變游戲規則
100 carat diamond
靈魂像是鑽石般的
雲端 依然穩穩站著
You can't see me comin
I'm a 木葉忍者
Gang gang gang gang
I'm making bank bank bank
數鈔票數到纍纍累
要走就走到飛飛飛 okay
這文字的藝術
弄得很清楚
說到底的確算是嘴上功夫
錢我不在乎
這是種態度
忍術
火遁 豪火球之術
你吃驚 見識這本事
這實力 Eminem二世
像特技 帶這到極致
二十一 準備乾大事
到國際 從這臺北市
穿Gucci 帶著金鏈子
我做beat 你們全都濕
Like Jay Z 開始造歷史
這使命 我扛一輩子
持續 突破 極致
That's on every single song
I spit
因為這是必須的
成為傳奇的資格
得到Title的飢渴
我說過我是路克天行者
Oh yeah
Imma訂新規則
超越自己每首饒舌
身手像個靈魂刺客
寫的每首R&B都把你逼到瘋了
I flex hard I'm a diamond
Crush me all
You want imma take no damage
Bling bling bling
That's how I be doing
You could call me HP
Printing paper by the minute
We going big
Reppin FP yea
We down with dis business
Tracks go flame when I'm in it
Diamond
Diamond
Diamond
I flex hard I'm a diamond
Spittin fire like a savage
You should quit rapping
Cut the jaw jack
Cuz your track wack
All of y'all flow trash
Come take me on a challenge
Goddamnit
I'm on a rampage
I can't hold back these emotions
Man I just can't manage
You can't imagine how a kid
On this island
Can spit like a god
but it doesn't matter
I'm no Marshall Mathers
I'm Lucious Lyon
Building my Empire
I'm gravity defying
like the Wright brothers
Told myself that Imma
Go ahead and make a deal
With Lucifer
I'm a deadly punisher
I got no mercy on this
lyric massacre
Man cuz low-key
That's my guilty pleasure
Let's start it from the bottom
from the day I started rhyming
a disciple to the rhythm
I became addicted to this adrena
line and now
I stand in front of
people doing what
I've dreamed of
hoping one day
I could make it
matter fact
I'll make it happen
whoah
Cuz I promised mother
That'll make it far
Put some extra dollars
In the cookie jar
And I'mma do it simply
Just by spittin bars
I'm still goin hard
Man I dont mess with
Y'all whack snitches
I can't deal with your ********
I've been messing around
With your main girl
Did you really think
She been loyal
Idiot sandwich
I'll be grinding hard
Till I'm dumb rich
I'll be making sure
That my tracks lit
I'll be ballin
Selling out stadiums
I'm on it
I'm outta here
