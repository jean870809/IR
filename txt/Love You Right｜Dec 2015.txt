Verse 1:
I’ve been thinking about you
ever since the day we met at the party
Have you thought about me
I think I need a little more of that body
Pre-Chorus:
Sorry for calling you so late
I promise it’ll be worth the wait
Chorus:
I just want to love you right
Everything you ever fantasized
Will come back to your mind
Why don’t we make love tonight
keep your lips pressing onto mine
with our bodies intertwined
Verse 2:
Every time I see you with that killa skin tight skirt (skrr skrr skrr)
it gets me going, uncontrollably skipping heartbeats
Your lipstick stain on my T-shirt
triggers me to get ready for the coming round 3
Pre-Chorus:
Sorry for calling you so late
I promise it’ll be worth the wait
Chorus:
I just want to love you right
Everything you ever fantasized
Will come back to your mind
Why don’t we make love tonight
keep your lips pressing onto mine
with our bodies intertwined
I just want to love you right
Everything you ever fantasized
Will come back to your mind
Why don’t we make love tonight
keep your lips pressing onto mine
with our bodies intertwined
Bridge:
You don’t have to think about it
You don’t have to think about it
Close your eyes and feel my body
Going back and forth, make you elevated
Baby let me love you harder
Baby let me love you harder
The way you touch me baby
Is this some typa indicator
You don’t have to think about it
You don’t have to think about it
Close your eyes and feel my body
Going back and forth, make you elevated
Baby let me love you harder
Baby let me love you harder
just let me take you for a ride
Chorus:
I just want to love you right
Everything you ever fantasized
Will come back to your mind
Why don’t we make love tonight
keep your lips pressing onto mine
with our bodies intertwined
I just want to love you right
Everything you ever fantasized
Will come back to your mind
Why don’t we make love tonight
keep your lips pressing onto mine
with our bodies intertwined
