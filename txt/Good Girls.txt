跳動放肆的血液衝上脈絡
嗅到新鮮氣味第一夜要找快活
多巴胺充斥控制大腦沒法擺脫
默契和溫柔都在瞬間無度揮霍
就讓這時間放慢停格甚至倒流
昏暗中絢麗消耗直到毫無保留
營造氣氛 控制多變氣溫
贏得積分 不願多敗一分
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls gone bad
汽水和Mentos擁吻爆炸化學反應
體溫觸碰到煙火燃放時間暫停
剎那間回到原始拋開理性感性
徹夜未眠燃放著眼球里的繁星
The night is still young
I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long
Tell me if I'm the girl that you’ve always wanted
I freestyle the topline with your drums and finesse a song
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls go bad
Everybody knows
They’ll love you more when you hold them really close (really close)
Everybody knows
They’ll love you more when you hold them really close (really close)
Good girls gone bad
Good girls gone bad
Good girls gone bad
When they give their hearts way too fast
Girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
You gotta let them know let them know they are different
Aren’t like any other girls that you’ve been with
Good girls gone bad
When they learned that feelings won’t last
